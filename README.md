## About Me

Hello, welcome to my GitHub profile! I have over 15 years of experience in the healthcare sector, with a strong focus on data analysis and process improvement. I hold postgraduate degrees in Data Science & Machine Learning and Quality Management & Patient Safety, and my goal here is to showcase my expertise in data-driven insights, clinical process optimization, and decision-making support.

### Professional Experience

- **Quality and Data Analyst at Prevent Senior**: I apply advanced data analysis tools such as R, Power BI, and SQL to create dashboards and reports that improve clinical processes and patient safety. I also automate workflows using Google Sheets and Power BI integration, and develop predictive models to support strategic decision-making.

- **15 Years of Experience in Healthcare Data Analysis**: My work spans across implementing statistical methods such as MCDA, Pareto analysis, and Control Charts to monitor and enhance clinical performance. Additionally, I apply optimization techniques like Linear Programming to maximize profits or minimize costs in healthcare operations.

- **Coordinator of the Patient Safety Team**: In my previous role, I led initiatives in patient safety and risk management, developing strategies to improve healthcare quality and safety, aligned with regulatory standards (e.g., QMENTUM, ISO 9001).
